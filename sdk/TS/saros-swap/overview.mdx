## Overview
The Saros SDK is a TypeScript library that lets developers interact with Saros Finance protocols on Solana. It abstracts away Solana’s low-level instructions and provides ready-to-use functions for:

- AMM (Automated Market Maker / Swap)

- Staking

- Farming (liquidity mining)

Instead of manually building and sending Solana transactions, developers can use the SDK to generate the right instructions and interact with Saros smart contracts easily.


## How it works (Features)

The Saros SDK is designed to simplify integration with core DeFi functions such as swaps, farming, and staking.

Developers use it to integrate DeFi capabilities into their applications, be it dApps, dashboards, bots, or scripts. Without needing to handle low-level Solana transactions themselves.

*Below is how it works for each feature:*

### 1. AMM (Swap / Liquidity)

The SDK provides methods to swap tokens and add/remove liquidity from pools.

Internally, it uses SarosSwap AMM smart contracts to calculate pool ratios and generate Solana instructions.

**Example usecases:**

- Swap SOL → USDC

- Provide liquidity to SOL/USDC pool

- Remove liquidity and receive underlying assets


### 2. Stake

The staking module allows users to stake Saros LP tokens or SAROS governance tokens into specific staking pools.

The SDK creates staking instructions that interact with Saros Staking smart contracts.

**Example usecases:**

- Stake SAROS to earn protocol rewards

- Stake LP tokens from liquidity pools for extra yield.


### 3. Farm

After providing liquidity and receiving LP tokens, users can deposit LP tokens into a Farm to earn yield (usually in SAROS or partner tokens).

**Example usecases:**

- Deposit LP tokens into a farm

- Withdraw tokens and earned rewards


## Use Cases

Saros SDK can be used to:

- Build a DeFi dashboard to show swaps, pool info, staking rewards, etc.

- Create wallet integrations with Saros functions (swap, stake, farm).

- Automate yield farming strategies (e.g., auto-compound rewards).
